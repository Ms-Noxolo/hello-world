# hello-world
I am embarking on a programming journey and one of the languages I look forward to learning and mastering is the CoffeeScript, not because I am a javaphile of anything like that ;)
I would like to think I have a good eye and a fine attention to detail. I have made some brilliant maps in my previous GIS work and I believe this will come in handy in the data visualization tasks that are to come.
